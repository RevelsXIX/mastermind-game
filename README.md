## **MASTERMIND**

--Mastermind game (Mastermind.py)--

This program, Mastermind.py, when executed will allow a 
user to play a variation on the game MASTERMIND. In this version of MASTERMIND, 
the solution is a permutation of a 4-digit number, each digit ranging from 1 to 9, 
where none of the digits repeat and no zeroes. The user gets 15 chances to guess the 
correct permutation before a game over. The program performs validation checks on each guess 
by the user before checking the userâ€™s guess against the correct solution

This game is played entirely in the console. The rules are you must enter a 4 digit code of
non-zero, distinct integers ranging from 1 to 9. You will have 15 guesses to correctly guess the code
before GAME OVER


This program was written in Python3 and requires Python3 to run.

This program can be run from the terminal by directing the terminal to the directory holding the
"Mastermind.py" file and typing "python3 Mastermind.py" in the command line. 

As stated, this game is played entirely in the console/terminal


P.S. get a GAME OVER on purpose at least once for some SPOOOOOKY ASCII art!!
